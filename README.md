Simple Dynamic Table with Restructuring Name and Id After Adding or Removing Column. 

I am making this code to simplify my task if there is any related task like this. 
The concept is:
There is one table with category and question, each category/question is placed on one row.

1. New category is placed under last question if any on current category. If there is no question on current category, New Category is placed right after the current category.
2. New question is placed under current question or current category.
3. Removing category is also removing questions inside.
4. Removing question is only removing question :D

If removing/adding row is in the middle of the table, there will be restructuring the other elements.
